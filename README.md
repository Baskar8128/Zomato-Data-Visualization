# Zomato-Data-Visualization

# Problem Statement:
Zomato is a popular restaurant discovery and food delivery service. Data analysis on the platform's data could be used to gain insights into customer preferences and behavior, as well as identify trends in the restaurant industry. To perform the analysis various methodologies such as Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Selection And Deployment can be used. Additionally, various data visualization techniques like bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, etc. could be employed to help communicate the insights gained from the analysis.Overall, data visualization can be used to effectively communicate the insights from Zomato data analysis to a wide range of stakeholders, including restaurants, food industry players, and investors. 

# Approach:

You’ll be able to access the zomato dataset and the country ISO code for all the countries in the dataset from the below URL.

# TASK 1: DATA ENGINEERING

 1. Add a column with rupees as the currency 
2 .Bring out a plot that compares indian currency with other country’s currency 

# TASK 2 : DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT 

The Plotly Dashboard that is being developed is recommended to have the following: 
●	Create a dropdown to choose the country-specific data 
○	Any two charts of your choice(maybe count, total sales, favorite cuisines, etc) 
●	Find which cuisines are costly in India 
●	Filter based on the city 
●	Which is famous cuisine in the city 
○	 Which is costlier cuisine 
○	Rating count in the city (based on rating test) 
○	Pie chart online delivery vs dine-in 
●	Comparison between the cities in India(own report) 
○	Which part of India spends more on online deliver
○	Which part of India spends more on dine-in 
○	Which part has a high living cost vs low living cost

# Results:

 You have to build a Plotly Dashboard that helps to analyze and improve zomato's business..
